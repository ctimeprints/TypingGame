# TypingGame
A Typing Practice Game Using JavaFX

This is a project from my Netbeans projects.
I used it as my practice course on java.

This mainly used JavaFX lib and I had a try on CSS to specify its UI.

Some bugs I already knew but haven't fix:
     In a game, when I clicked the pause button, I still can press keys and the paused letters are able to got hit.
     I really don't know how to delete unused objects in the memory( I treat letters falling down as objects, as Bubble class). So when I change the difficulty to the highest ( 5 specificly) the game will occupy a lot memory as it created a lot bubbles.
